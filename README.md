# RockPaperScissor
RockPaperScissor game from the Odin Project

It is working for 5 rounds.

One thing that could be improve is to make a function to automatically compare each of the elements.
This way we can make only 3 comparison:

Rock > Scissor
Rock < Paper
Paper < Scissor

And instead of having 7 ifs we could more easily see who would win each round.
